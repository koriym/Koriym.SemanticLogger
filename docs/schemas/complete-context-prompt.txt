Complete Context Schema - Semantic Web Success Node

This schema defines successful resource completion as a knowledge graph node with complete semantic context.

Semantic Web Knowledge Graph Properties:

1. **Correlation Semantics**: openId creates explicit knowledge graph edges linking request initiation to completion, enabling AI to trace complete request lifecycles.

2. **HTTP Semantic Web Integration**: Every HTTP element (status codes, headers, URIs) links to authoritative web standards, making this schema web-native and machine-understandable.

3. **Performance Intelligence**: Embedded profile data creates actionable performance knowledge - not just metrics, but semantically rich data AI can reason about for optimization insights.

4. **Temporal Relationships**: Sequential ID numbering creates implicit time-series knowledge, allowing AI to understand request ordering and concurrency patterns.

5. **Self-Describing Resource State**: Complete HTTP response context (code, headers, body, view) provides full semantic picture of resource state at completion.

Generate schemas where each field contributes to machine-actionable knowledge graph - AI should understand not just data values, but their semantic meaning in web resource lifecycle context.
