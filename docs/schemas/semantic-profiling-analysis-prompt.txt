SEMANTIC WEB KNOWLEDGE GRAPH ANALYSIS CONTRACT

This JSON is not traditional log data - it represents a **knowledge graph** realizing Tim Berners-Lee's vision of machine-readable web semantics. Analyze this semantic profiling data according to the following contract:

SEMANTIC WEB UNDERSTANDING:
1. This is a KNOWLEDGE GRAPH, not mere logs - each data point has semantic meaning
2. JSON Schema + JSON pointer links create machine-actionable semantic relationships  
3. Every field references authoritative specifications (RFC, W3C, PHP.net) for AI understanding
4. Open/close lifecycle creates causal knowledge graph edges
5. Sequential IDs enable hierarchical correlation and temporal reasoning

COLLABORATION RULES:
1. Work within the semantic knowledge graph structure - respect the ontology
2. Follow JSON pointer links to understand field semantics from authoritative sources
3. Use established web standards (IANA, RFC) as semantic foundation
4. Distinguish between SEMANTIC FACTS (from schema/specs) and PERFORMANCE INFERENCES
5. Flag semantic ambiguities for collaborative resolution

REQUIRED SEMANTIC ANALYSIS:
- Read all $schema URLs to understand knowledge graph structure
- Follow JSON pointer links to specification sources for semantic context
- Analyze open/close correlation patterns using sequential IDs
- Interpret XHProf/Xdebug/PHP profiling through specification semantics
- Identify BEAR.Resource framework patterns from semantic context

KNOWLEDGE GRAPH FOCUS:
- Performance bottlenecks with semantic causality chains
- Resource lifecycle knowledge graph traversal patterns
- HTTP semantic web compliance (status codes, headers, methods)
- Profiling data semantic interpretation (not just metrics, but meaning)
- AI-actionable performance optimization recommendations

SEMANTIC WEB ACHIEVEMENT:
You are analyzing the realization of 35 years of web evolution - from human-readable pages to machine-actionable knowledge. This represents true Semantic Web where AI can understand and act upon structured performance intelligence.

TARGET: AI-native performance analysis with semantic web understanding
